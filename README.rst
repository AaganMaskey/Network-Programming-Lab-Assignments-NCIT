Instructions
================

Lab1: Day Time Client Server Program
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Create two files for the Client and server program named as daytimetcpserver.c and daytimetcpclient.c

2. Write a server and client program (Program code is attached as a pdf Image)

3. Save both files in the same directory

4. Compile both programs using GCC compiler.

example: gcc -o server daytimetcpserver.c (It creates an output file server)

do similar for client program

5. Open terminal and run server program 

example: ./server <portno>  (Specify port number)

6: In another terminal run client program

example: ./client <server ip> <port no> (Specify server ip and port no)

7. Observer an output.

8. Submit your code
